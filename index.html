            <h3>Educational Goals and Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>
              After graduating in 2005 I became successfully employed in the
              information Technology Department. My goal is to earn a degree in
              Computer Management which will help me to become more marketable
              while increasing my salary.

            <h3>Future Career Goals</h3>
            <p>
              My future career goal is to acquire a position in management. I
              have been working in the Technology Department for over 15 years
              specifically doing Litigation Support. This position requires a
              lot of hands on as well as good problem-solving skills since no
              request is ever the same.

            <h3>Greatest Non-Educational Accomplishment</h3>
            <p>
              One of my greatest non educational accomplishments is owning my
              own travel business. Away from work I sell travel on a part time
              basis. I've been selling travel for over 10 years. Although my
              travel business doesn't earn a lot of income due to big name
              competitors, I still enjoy it because I love to travel. As an
              Independent Travel Agent, I do enjoy many discounted benefits at
              hotels and from other tour operators. Some to the discounts are
              more than 50% and it is also extended to any guest traveling with
              me. These benefits are indeed worth a lot and because I travel it
              does help.

              My personal interest is to work less and earn more. I enjoy
              traveling, I love to visit different places and indulged in
              culture and foods or different origins. I have done a great amount
              of traveling over the years.
